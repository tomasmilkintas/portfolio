### Vision

This will be where I store my projects in order to have them in one place,
both with links to the hosted sites and the github repositories

### Plan

The Plan is to have 3 sections:

-   Vision
-   About
-   Projects

Each of them will highlight the areas about me and my work. With vision I will
aim to describe my current and future goals, what kind of work I am looking for
in the future.

About section will highlight the areas I specialize in, as well as my how I came towards
the web development / software engineering path.

Projects will showcase my current and past work and the technologies used. A brief description
with links to the hosted projects, as well as the link to individual github repositories for
deeper dive into the code itself.

### Technology

For the creation of this project the following were used:

-   ReactJS
-   Semanti-ui
