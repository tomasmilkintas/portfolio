### Vision

This will be where I store my projects in order to have them in one place,
both with links to the hosted sites and the github repositories.

### Plan

The Plan is to primarily showcase the projects in a minimalistic style. It will also
feature a scrollable environment, so that the person looking doesn't have to click,
and click, and click to move around the portfolio.

Projects will showcase my current and past work and the technologies used. A brief description
with links to the hosted projects, as well as the link to individual github repositories for
deeper dive into the code itself.

### Technology

For the creation of this project the following were used:

-   ReactJS
-   Semanti-ui
